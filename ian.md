Ideas, priorities, and extras for sudoku (good read for drew lets get the game working before all else)

Priority 1:
1.Store the puzzle and its solution in to local storage and use that to set the puzzle board
change the visual representation of the 'x's to empty spaces
2.Make a location for number of failures left, 
3.Allow input of variables to the board, using the solution to compare against the original and say if the piece put in was valid or//// get drew to create some cool animation that
makes it obvious that it was a valid piece.
4.Check the board for a complete success (let's just use the token solution)
5.When the game is won, ask the player if they'd like to play again

Priority 2:
Make a database that stores 2000~ of these puzzles we'll just start with 100-200
Make a location for easy, medium, hard bttns
Create hard-medium puzzles

Priority 3:
Create SFX and music for the sudoku board.
